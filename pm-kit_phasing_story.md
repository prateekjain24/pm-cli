# pm-kit — Phasing & Story Document (CLI-first, PM-friendly)

## Vision
Make PRDs, roadmaps, OKRs, personas, and release notes **live in Git**, flow through **review gates like code**, and **publish out** to Confluence/Notion without flags or copy‑paste. One mental model; zero doc chaos.

## Core Principles
- **Local-first, publish-later.** Git is the source of truth; wikis are mirrors.
- **Zero-brain CLI.** Defaults > flags. Infer from cwd, `.pmrc.yaml`, and `manifest.yaml`.
- **Deterministic phases.** Only re-run what changed; resume where comments start.
- **Quality gates.** Block merges on ambiguity/TBD/missing metrics.
- **Traceability.** Every story maps to an issue; every issue maps back to the PRD line.

## Primary Users
- **PM (owner):** authors, publishes, syncs traceability.
- **Design/Eng leads (reviewers):** comment + approve gates.
- **Leaders/CS/Marketing (consumers):** read published mirrors.

## Success (first 90 days)
- ≥70% of PM docs authored in repo (not wiki).
- Median PRD PR review cycle ≤ 48h.
- ≥90% of merged PRDs have stories auto-synced to issues with back-links.
- Release notes generated for every tagged release.

## Information Architecture (opinionated)

```
/product/
  prds/<slug>/
    01_problem.md
    02_solution.md
    03_requirements.md
    04_prototype_prompts.md
    05_final_prd.md
    manifest.yaml           # owner, okr, links, published URLs, story map
    .cache/                 # content hashes per phase
  personas/*.md
  okrs/*.yaml
  roadmap/roadmap.yaml
  releases/*.md
.pmrc.yaml                  # org defaults: publisher, space, jira project, gates, template pack
```

**`.pmrc.yaml` (defaults, not flags):**
```yaml
publisher: confluence        # or notion
confluence: { space: PROD, parent_page_id: 12345 }
jira: { project: PROD }
gates: { lint: strict, block_on_tbd: true, block_on_metrics_missing: true }
templates: acme/default@1.0.0
```

**CLI verbs (minimal):** `pm new` · `pm run` · `pm review` · `pm publish` · `pm sync` · `pm release` · `pm build` · `pm status`

# Phases

> Each phase lists **Goal**, what it **Creates**, **User Stories**, **Acceptance**, **Tasks**, and the expected zero‑flag **Commands**.

## Phase 0 — Setup & Scaffolding
**Goal:** Project births PM artifacts with one command; repo conventions locked.

**Creates:** `/.pmrc.yaml`, template pack pinned, CI job for gates, PR template, CODEOWNERS.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, I can bootstrap once and never think about config again.

**Acceptance**
- Running `pm new prd "Feature Name"` in a clean repo works first try.
- CI “pm-gates” job runs lint/schema checks on PRs touching `/product`.

**Tasks**
- Generate `.pmrc.yaml` with sensible defaults (detect Confluence/Notion via env vars).
- Install GitHub Action `pm-gates` (lint/schema/broken links/glossary).
- Template pack loader (version-pinned for reproducibility).
- PR template & CODEOWNERS autogenerated for `/product/**`.

**Commands**
```
pm new project
```

---

## Phase 1 — PRD Creation (Repo-first)
**Goal:** Author a PRD via deterministic phases with no inter‑phase chatter.

**Creates:** `/product/prds/<slug>/*` and `manifest.yaml`.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, I can create a new PRD from a name and get structured phase docs.
- As a PM, I can re-run only the pieces impacted by my edits.

**Acceptance**
- `pm run` generates 5 files with required sections; no TBD/“easy/simple” terms.
- `.cache` shows hashes; a second `pm run` is a no-op if nothing changed.

**Tasks**
- Orchestrator DAG: P1→P2→P3→P4→P5 (final assembly).
- Hash inputs: prior phase outputs + template version + orchestrator version.
- Strict section validator; ambiguity dictionary.

**Commands**
```
pm new prd "Connect Session Replay to Funnel Analysis"
pm run
```

**Defaults**
- `slug` inferred from name.
- Owner inferred from git config.
- OKR suggested from nearest `/product/okrs/*.yaml` objective tags.

---

## Phase 2 — Collaboration & Quality Gates
**Goal:** Treat doc PRs like code: lint, schema, broken-link, glossary, required reviewers.

**Creates:** PR annotations, gate config; enforced CODEOWNERS.

**User Stories**
- As a reviewer, I see pass/fail gates and actionable fix suggestions inline.
- As a PM, the PR blocks if metrics are not measurable or personas missing.

**Acceptance**
- PRs fail on TBD/ambiguous terms, missing metrics, or orphan personas.
- Required reviewers (Design/Eng) enforced via CODEOWNERS.

**Tasks**
- Lint rules: ambiguity, measurable metric formats, persona cross-refs, section completeness.
- Reviewdog annotations in PR.
- CODEOWNERS for `/product/**` with PM/Design/Eng groups.

**Commands**
```
pm status     # local dry-run of gates before opening PR
```

---

## Phase 3 — Review Mode (Comment‑Driven Regen)
**Goal:** Pull wiki comments, re-run from earliest impacted phase, push back.

**Creates:** Updated phase files + `manifest.yaml` review log.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, I paste a wiki URL; the tool fixes from the earliest commented phase onward.
- As a PM, I don’t fiddle flags; it figures out scope.

**Acceptance**
- Comments map to phases via page titles/anchors.
- `pm review <url>` regenerates from earliest phase with comments → `pm publish` mirrors back.

**Tasks**
- Confluence/Notion adapters: fetch parent & children (with comments).
- Heuristic & anchor-based phase mapping.
- Deterministic regen window: earliest..end.

**Commands**
```
pm review https://confluence/.../PRD-Session-Replay
pm publish
```

---

## Phase 4 — Traceability (Stories ⇄ Issues)
**Goal:** Create/Update issues from PRD stories; PRD shows live status checkboxes.

**Creates:** GitHub/Jira issues with deep links back to PRD anchors; status injector.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, my PRD’s user stories become tracked issues automatically.
- As a PM, I see checkboxes in the PRD update as issues move.

**Acceptance**
- Idempotent upsert; re-running doesn’t duplicate.
- Every story in `03_requirements.md` has an issue link + back-link.

**Tasks**
- Story parser (front-matter IDs, acceptance criteria).
- GitHub/Jira adapters + mapping stored in `manifest.yaml`.
- Status poller Action to refresh PRD on push/cron.

**Commands**
```
pm sync issues
pm sync status
```

---

## Phase 5 — Planning Data (Roadmap & OKRs as YAML)
**Goal:** Roadmap/OKRs as structured data that render to pretty docs.

**Creates:** `roadmap.yaml`, `okrs.yaml` + generated `roadmap.md`.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, I edit roadmap/OKRs in YAML and publish human-friendly Markdown/Gantt.
- As a leader, I filter by quarter, OKR, persona.

**Acceptance**
- Schema-validated; build fails on invalid enum/refs.
- Links to PRDs & issues resolve.

**Tasks**
- YAML schemas + renderer (Mermaid/Gantt optional).
- Filters (`--team`, `--quarter`, `--okr`) available on build (defaults from cwd context).

**Commands**
```
pm build roadmap
pm build okrs
```

---

## Phase 6 — Publish & Distribute
**Goal:** Mirror repo docs to Confluence/Notion with stable URLs.

**Creates:** Pages in destination, cross-page links, breadcrumb to repo.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, I publish once; everything lands in the right space/parent with links home.

**Acceptance**
- Idempotent: content hashes prevent unnecessary updates.
- Final output: a single summary message with page links (nothing else).

**Tasks**
- Publisher adapters map local files → page titles.
- Hash-based skip; archive behavior for removed files.

**Commands**
```
pm publish
```

---

## Phase 7 — Release Notes Automation
**Goal:** Draft release notes from merged PRs/issues since last tag, enriched by PRD “Why it matters”.

**Creates:** `/product/releases/<date>-vX.Y.md` + changelog index.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, I run one command and get categorized, human-grade notes I lightly edit.

**Acceptance**
- Sections: New, Improvements, Fixes, Breaking; each has links + “Impact” line.
- Internal vs external template modes set by `.pmrc.yaml`.

**Tasks**
- Harvest PRs/issues by label since last tag.
- Summarize; inject PRD impact when story link exists.
- Generate changelog index page.

**Commands**
```
pm release draft
```

---

## Phase 8 — Handoff to Engineering (Spec‑Kit Bridge)
**Goal:** Translate PRD into Eng spec/plan/tasks in the code repo with links both ways.

**Creates:** PR in eng repo with spec/plan/tasks referencing PRD anchors.

**User Stories**
- As a PM, I kick off engineering with a ready-to-review spec and task skeleton.

**Acceptance**
- Tasks carry story IDs; contract tests and non-goals preserved.
- PR description contains PRD links by section.

**Tasks**
- Repo handshake + PR creation.
- Transform requirements → Spec Kit inputs.
- Bidirectional link injectors.

**Commands**
```
pm handoff
```

---

## Phase 9 — Enterprise & Packs
**Goal:** RBAC, audit, template packs; teams install industry packs without fork.

**Creates:** Role matrix, audit trail, `pm pack` registry.

**User Stories**
- As a PM in regulated space, I install a fintech pack and get extra gates/sections.

**Acceptance**
- Audit export for a date range.
- Pack version pinned; reproducible outputs.

**Tasks**
- SSO/RBAC hooks (enforced via CI).
- Pack manifest + loader; example packs (B2C, B2B, Fintech).
- Audit CLI export.

**Commands**
```
pm pack add org/fintech@1.2.0
pm audit export --since 2025-01-01
```

---

# Minimal CLI—How Flags Get Avoided
- **Context from cwd:** subfolder `/product/prds/<slug>` sets the target PRD.
- **Publisher from `.pmrc.yaml`:** no `--dest` unless per-run override.
- **Scope inference:** `pm run` uses hashes; `pm review <url>` computes regen window; `pm release draft` uses last Git tag.
- **Identity:** owner from git config; teams from CODEOWNERS.
- **OKR linkage:** nearest OKR file by quarter; only prompt if multiple candidates.

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Confluence/Notion API quirks** → idempotent publisher, exponential backoff, dry-run mode.
- **PMs skipping gates** → block merges on high-severity, allow override with justification tag.
- **Template sprawl** → pack registry with owners, version pinning, deprecation policy.
- **Jira/GitHub drift** → idempotent upserts keyed by story IDs; nightly reconcile.

---

- [ ] Confluence publisher (idempotent, tree mapping)
- [ ] Review mode: comment ingestion + regen window
- [ ] Traceability: `pm sync issues`, status injector
